dolfn (pronounced "dolphin") is a stack-based [concatenative programming language](http://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Concatenative%20language) with a focus on simplicity, power, and extensibility, specifically the ease of creation and use of [domain specific languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language). The core language is small so that it is easy for a beginner to learn. This is a python implementation but its main purpose will be for bootstrapping. Once it is finished, I will attempt to write a self-compiler that will output assembly language (it may end up generating C code because I don't yet know assembly) in order to have a fast enough language.
